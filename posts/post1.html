          We have made a discovery. A discovery that presents itself as a machine that is powerful beyond limits. 
          It is a machine that is proven to bring chaos and peace. It brings disparity and unity. It is one that destroys and elevates. 
          Most importantly, it is a machine that threatens and preserves humanity as we know it. It is seen as a gift by many and a burden by some. 
          It is a blessing and a curse in its usage and its neglect. It is the oldest tool in the box and the most efficient one of all. 
          It is the intelligence that is not preceded by the word artificial, but by its creator: “The Human”.

          Thinking about AI today has made me reflect on a tale almost 3,000 years old. Prometheus, a Titan in Greek mythology, 
          defied the gods by stealing fire from Mount Olympus and giving it to humanity. For humans, it was a gift that enabled progress, 
          civilization, and innovation. However, for this act, he was punished severely by Zeus—chained to a rock where an eagle would devour his liver daily. 
          Why, then, was he condemned for helping humanity and giving them a chance to grow and evolve? 
          Even though the same fire that he gave humans was one that could warm homes, cook food, and forge tools, 
          it also had the potential to burn civilizations down to ashes.
        </p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-indent: 30px; line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1.1em;">        
          It is not the tool itself that can be evaluated; it is, in fact, the hand that wields it. 
          This myth captures a timeless truth: tools themselves are not the threat; it’s how people choose to use them. 
          From fire to AI, from the internet to nuclear energy, the danger doesn’t lie in invention but in intention. 
          Prometheus wasn’t punished for fire, but perhaps for believing too much in what humanity would do with it.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0; text-indent: 30px; line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1.1em;">
          I would like to conclude with this: In Romans 12:21, we are commanded: “Do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good.” 
          Evil is not a relic of the past; it lives, adapts, and resurfaces in new forms across time. However, I believe with every fibre in my being 
          that Goodness will always exist, and it will always prevail. Therefore, to whoever is reading this, I urge you to examine your discipline 
          and seek the good produce that may result from your work. Believe in the fight against evil and equip yourself—not with fear, 
          but with faith, integrity, and honour.
